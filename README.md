# Yahboom IMU 10-Axis Inertial Navigation ARHS Sensor Module with Accelerometer Gyroscope Magnetometer Barometer Air pressure gauge
![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/10-axis_IMU_Module/blob/main/Yahboom_IMU_Module.jpg)
# Introduction
This is a high-precision inertial measurement module that integrates 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and a barometer. The baud rate is 921600, the return rate can reach 200Hz. Built-in algorithm can stably acquire and output data such as magnetic field vector, acceleration, gyroscope, and quaternion. It supports USB/UART/I2C communication methods, which can be applied to many different occasions. We provide PC software, which allows users to adjust the parameters of the module in real time, and reflect the real attitude of the inertial navigation module in real time through the 3D model.
# Features
1)On-board 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer and barometer.

2)Support USB/UART/I2C communication methods.

3) Built-in Kalman algorithm, it can output Euler angles (Roll, Pitch, Yaw), quaternion, position, velocity, acceleration, angular velocity, magnetic field vector.

4) Yahboom unique metal case can effectively help the module to dissipate heat and reduce the interference of the external environment.

5)Support ROS system and PC software debugging, a lot of tutorials and source codes for free.
